Systematic variations
======================

A *systematic variation* is an alternate outcome in the value of one or more columns. 

* ``reader`` can be of a different column with the same data type.
* ``constant`` can be of a different value.
* ``equation`` can be of different expression, as long as its signature and return type are compatible with the nominal's.
* ``definition`` and ``representation`` can be constructed with a different set of constructor arguments, or modified manually.
